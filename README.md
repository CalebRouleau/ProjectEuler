ProjectEuler
============

Solutions to projecteuler.net problems with some focus on creating reusable code as I go. 

all files should be testable by running the command "python filename.py test"

Q36 is solved by DoubleBase.py
Q37 is solved by Truncatable.py
Q38 is solved by Pandigital.py
Q39 is solved by Triangle.py
Q40 is solved by Champernowne.py


Realized that ProjectEuler does not want solutions to these problems to become widely available, 
so I am going to stop updating this repo. I might switch over to bitbucket.
